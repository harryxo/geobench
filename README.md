# GeoGuesser AI Benchmark 

This project aims to evaluate and compare the capabilities of various multimodal AI models in identifying geographic locations from images, inspired by the popular game GeoGuessr. It provides both a benchmarking script for systematic evaluation 
and a web interface for visualizing results and performing interactive comparisons.
